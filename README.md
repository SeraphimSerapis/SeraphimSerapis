# Tim Messerschmidt


## üë®‚Äçüíª Biography

Hello there! My name is Tim, and for the past fourteen years, I've been advocating for, serving, and enabling developers across several Developer Relations teams.

In my current role, I oversee [Community](https://developers.google.com/community) and [Startup](https://startup.google.com/accelerator/) Programs for Google's Developer Relations Ecosystem team in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. My favorite technologies are the AI space (especially open models), [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter), and anything related to home automation. Furthermore, I'm passionate about identity and security technology -- this is why I authored a [book for O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920044376.do) covering best practices for web developers. Before joining Google in 2016, I ran PayPal's Developer and Startup Relations team in EMEA and APAC.

When I'm not driving innovation for developers, I enjoy conquering challenging climbs on my road bike.

## üé§ Public Speaking

I have a passion for public speaking -- here are some examples of talks I have given:

- [The Magic of Flutter @ GDG DevFest Ukraine 2017](https://youtu.be/0IY6J5baAj8)
- [Engaging Across the Business @ DevRelCon UK 2016](https://youtu.be/7HYIuEm5_cg)
- [Node JS Authentication and Data Security @ JSConf Asia 2015](https://youtu.be/a8zYmRmtss0)
- [Supercharging Node with Kraken @ JSConf EU 2014](https://youtu.be/gKebfQH8aXU)
- [Future of Payments @ Codemotion Milan 2014](https://youtu.be/6YeYSpZ4Ukw)

In the past couple of years, most of my public speaking activities have focused on company-internal events and the facilitation of public speaking workshops I run for the developer community and specifically for people from underrepresented groups.

## ü§ñ What I currently play with

As stated in my bio above, I'm a massive fan of anything connected to home automation. I love using [Docker](https://github.com/docker), [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), and [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core) to make my life easier and automate processes.
