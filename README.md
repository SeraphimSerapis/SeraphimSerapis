## üë®‚Äçüíª Biography

I've been working in Developer Relations for more than 10 years. In my current role, I oversee [Community Programs](https://developers.google.com/community), Operations, and Regions for Google's Developer Relations Ecosystem team in Europe. My favorite technologies are [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter) and anything related to home automation. In 2016, Tim authored [a book about web security and identity](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920044376.do) for O'Reilly. Before joining Google, he ran PayPal's Developer and Startup Relations team in EMEA and APAC.
