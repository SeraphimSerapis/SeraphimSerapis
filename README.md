# Tim Messerschmidt


## üë®‚Äçüíª Biography

Hello there! My name is Tim, and for the past ten years, I've been advocating for, serving, and enabling developers across several Developer Relations teams.

In my current role, I oversee [Community Programs](https://developers.google.com/community), Operations, and Regions for Google's Developer Relations Ecosystem team in Europe, Israel, and Russia. My favorite technologies are [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter) and anything related to home automation. Furthermore, I'm passionate about identity and security technology -- this is why I authored a [book for O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920044376.do) covering best practices for web developers.

Before joining Google in 2016, I ran PayPal's Developer and Startup Relations team in EMEA and APAC. The Developer Relations Ecosystem team prides itself in being a truly global organization that ensures developers' voices are heard and represented -- no matter their background, career stage, or geographic location.

## üé§ Public Speaking

I have a passion for public speaking -- here are some examples of talks I have given:

## ü§ñ What I currently play with

As stated in my bio, I am a massive fan of anything connected to home automation. I love using [Docker](https://github.com/docker), [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), and [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core) to make my life easier and automate processes.
