# Tim Messerschmidt


## üë®‚Äçüíª Biography

Hello there! My name is Tim, and for the past fifteen years, I've been advocating for, serving, and enabling developers across several Developer Relations teams.

I'm deeply convinced of the profound impact technology has on improving people's lives everywhere, and this mission drives my work. In my current role, I lead the program strategy and execution for Google's Developer Relations Ecosystem team, serving developers and startups across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. I'm a dedicated AI enthusiast and I love exploring the bleeding edge of technology to understand where the industry is headed next.

I'm passionate about identity and security technology‚Äîwhich is why I authored a [book for O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920044376.do) covering best practices for web developers. Before joining Google in 2016, I ran PayPal's Developer and Startup Relations team in EMEA and APAC.

When I'm not driving innovation for developers, I enjoy conquering challenging climbs on my road bike.

## üé§ Public Speaking

I have a passion for public speaking‚Äîhere are some examples of talks I have given:

- [The Magic of Flutter @ GDG DevFest Ukraine 2017](https://youtu.be/0IY6J5baAj8)
- [Engaging Across the Business @ DevRelCon UK 2016](https://youtu.be/7HYIuEm5_cg)
- [Node JS Authentication and Data Security @ JSConf Asia 2015](https://youtu.be/a8zYmRmtss0)
- [Supercharging Node with Kraken @ JSConf EU 2014](https://youtu.be/gKebfQH8aXU)
- [Future of Payments @ Codemotion Milan 2014](https://youtu.be/6YeYSpZ4Ukw)

In recent years, my focus has shifted to delivering keynotes for major events such as Google I/O Connect in EMEA, in addition to facilitating public speaking workshops I run for the developer community and specifically for people from underrepresented groups.

## ü§ñ What I currently play with

As stated in my bio above, I'm a massive fan of anything connected to Artificial Intelligence. I love using [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) with [Gemma](https://github.com/google-deepmind/gemma), [Docker](https://github.com/docker), and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) to make my life easier and automate processes.
